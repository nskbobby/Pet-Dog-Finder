#Pet-Dog-Finder - Getting Started

Pet-Dog-Finder is a React.js-based web app that helps users find adoptable dogs through the Fetch Rewards API. It utilizes Axios for seamless API communication and Material UI for a modern, responsive design.

Users can browse available dogs, favorite their preferred ones, and receive a randomly assigned match based on their choices. Once matched, they get adoption details to pick up their new furry friend.

#🔐 Enabling Third-Party Cookies for Safari & Incognito Mode
Since the Pet-Dog-Finder app relies on cookies for authentication , you may encounter issues if third-party cookies are disabled in Safari or Incognito mode in Chrome. Here’s how you can enable third-party cookies to ensure seamless functionality:

##📱 For Safari:
Open Safari on your Mac or iOS device.
Go to Settings (on Mac, click Safari in the top menu and select Preferences).
Navigate to the Privacy tab.
Uncheck the option that says Prevent Cross-Site Tracking (this allows third-party cookies to be sent).
Reload the app in Safari for the changes to take effect.
Note: This will allow third-party cookies for all websites, not just Pet-Dog-Finder. Be mindful of your privacy preferences after enabling this setting.

##🕵️‍♂️ For Incognito Mode in Chrome:
Open Google Chrome and click the three dots at the top-right corner of the browser.
Go to Settings → Privacy and Security → Cookies and other site data.
Scroll down and ensure that Allow all cookies is selected. Alternatively, you can also allow third-party cookies for specific sites.
Restart Chrome or close and reopen your Incognito window.
Note: Incognito mode often blocks third-party cookies by default for privacy reasons. Enabling this setting will ensure proper functionality for Pet-Dog-Finder.
